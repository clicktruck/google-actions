### Deliberate

Administer resources one at a time.

There are two types of actions defined, those that can be manually triggered (i.e., dispatched), and those that can only be called by another action.  All actions are located [here](../../../actions) and can be run by providing the required parameters.  Go [here](../../.github/workflows) to inspect the source for each action.

> Note that for most dispatch actions, you have the option to either create or destroy the resources.

## Accessing credentials

All Credentials are stored in Google Cloud Secrets Manager.

First, configure Google Cloud using the service account credentials you created earlier

Go visit the Secret Manager Secrets Terraform module's [README](https://github.com/clicktruck/google-terraform/tree/main/modules/secrets-manager-secrets/README.md#accessing-a-secret) for how to retrieve secrets.
